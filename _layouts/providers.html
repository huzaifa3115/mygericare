              <h4>Marlene Varnavas</h4>
              <p>FNP</p>
              <p>It is said that it’s a beautiful thing when a career and a passion come together. With over a decade of
                clinical and administrative experience as a nursing professional, Marlene is Family Nurse practitioner who
                works with Gericare Ltd. In her current role, she is committed to delivering the highest quality healthcare
                to her patients through a holistic
                approach and the highest levels of clinical competencies. Bilingual in English and Spanish, Marlene received
                her bachelor’s degree from Purdue University and her master’s degree from North Park University. She is
                fully certified and licensed to practice in the State of Illinois. Marlene served in roles such as Assistant
                Director of Nursing, Director of Nursing, and Administrative Nursing Supervisor. These roles expanded her
                view of the nursing field and healthcare administration. She quickly honed her decision-making skills and
                leadership abilities, inspiring others to excellence. Ultimately, Marlene missed the direct care of patients
                and interactions with the families. She went back to school and became a Family Nurse Practitioner, which
                enabled her to reconnect with patient care and serve others. She has extensive experience in acute care
                settings and long-term care facilities and she is truly passionate about geriatric medicine, prevention and
                management of chronic diseases.</p>
